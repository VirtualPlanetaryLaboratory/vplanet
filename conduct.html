<h1>Code of Conduct<a class="headerlink" href="#code-of-conduct" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This code of conduct outlines expectations for participation in the open source
development of <code class="code docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">VPLanet</span></code>, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behavior. We
are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all. People
violating this code of conduct may be permanently banned from contributing code
and participating in workshops, outreach, or other activities. As Mark Claire
famously quipped, “Planets are hard.” Let’s not make understanding planetary
evolution any harder  by failing to hold ourselves to these standards.</p>
<section id="our-standards">
<h2>Our Standards<a class="headerlink" href="#our-standards" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people</p></li>
<li><p>Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences</p></li>
<li><p>Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback</p></li>
<li><p>Accepting responsibility, apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and
learning from the experience</p></li>
<li><p>Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
community</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The VPLanet community strives to:</p>
<p>Be friendly and patient: Remember you might not be communicating in someone
else’s primary spoken or programming language, and others may not have your
level of understanding.</p>
<p>Be welcoming: We welcome and support people of all backgrounds and identities.
This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture,
national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class,
educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression,
age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical
ability.</p>
<p>Be respectful: Science is a world-wide community of professionals, and we
conduct ourselves professionally. Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior
and poor manners. Disrespectful and unacceptable behavior includes, but is not
limited to:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Violent threats or language.</p></li>
<li><p>Discriminatory or derogatory jokes and language.</p></li>
<li><p>Posting sexually explicit or violent material.</p></li>
<li><p>Posting, or threatening to post, people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”).</p></li>
<li><p>Insults, especially those using discriminatory terms or slurs.</p></li>
<li><p>Behavior that could be perceived as sexual attention.</p></li>
<li><p>Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Understand disagreements: Disagreements, both social and technical, are useful
learning opportunities, especially in an interdisciplinary community. Seek to
understand the other viewpoints and resolve differences constructively.</p>
<p>This code of conduct is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to capture our
common understanding of a productive, collaborative environment. We expect the
code to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.</p>
</section>
<section id="scope">
<h2>Scope<a class="headerlink" href="#scope" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This Code of Conduct applies to all contributors/participants within all
community spaces.</p>
</section>
<section id="collaboration-and-development-guidelines">
<h2>Collaboration and Development Guidelines<a class="headerlink" href="#collaboration-and-development-guidelines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We will respect the scientific work of others, both within the collaboration and
without, through written acknowledgement and/or appropriate citations within
papers. We will accept requests by original authors for such appropriate
acknowledgment. When utilizing code written by active group members, they will
be consulted with prior to publication and offered appropriate authorship on the
paper. In the case of non-active group members, each member will be consulted as
to what role they would like in future publications, and we will adhere to their
wishes.</p>
<p>Code development by collaboration members that is performed on separate git
branches/forks will be treated as proprietary. Such code shall not be made public
in any way nor used by any group member without the explicit consent of the code
author, or any proxy which they have explicitly assigned to act on their behalf.
Code that is merged with the main branches of the VPLanet GitHub repositories
(vplanet, vplot, vspace, multi-planet, and bigplanet) will be assumed to be
open for public use. All code development should be done with the goal of
eventually merging with the public branch of the repository in question.</p>
</section>
<section id="reporting-code-of-conduct-issues">
<h2>Reporting Code of Conduct Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#reporting-code-of-conduct-issues" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We encourage all communities to resolve issues on their own whenever possible.
This builds a broader and deeper understanding, and ultimately a healthier
interaction. In the event that an issue cannot be resolved locally, please
report your concerns by contacting one or more members of the VPLanet Council,
which provides leadership and guidance for the project. Currently this group
consists of Rory Barnes (<a class="reference external" href="mailto:rory&#37;&#52;&#48;astro&#46;washington&#46;edu">rory<span>&#64;</span>astro<span>&#46;</span>washington<span>&#46;</span>edu</a>), Peter Driscoll
(<a class="reference external" href="mailto:pdriscoll&#37;&#52;&#48;carnegiescience&#46;edu">pdriscoll<span>&#64;</span>carnegiescience<span>&#46;</span>edu</a>) and Rodrigo Luger (<a class="reference external" href="mailto:rodluger&#37;&#52;&#48;gmail&#46;com">rodluger<span>&#64;</span>gmail<span>&#46;</span>com</a>), who have
all committed to abiding by this code of conduct . All complaints will be
reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community members, including
those on the VPLanet Council, are obligated to respect the privacy and security
of the reporter of any incident.</p>
<p>If you decide to send in a report, please include:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Your contact information.</p></li>
<li><p>Names (real, usernames or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well.</p></li>
<li><p>Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public chat log), please include a link or attachment.</p></li>
<li><p>Any additional information that may be helpful.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>All reports will be reviewed by the multi-person VPLanet Council and will result
in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
Where additional perspectives are needed, the Council may seek insight from
others with relevant expertise or experience.  Involved parties, including
Council members, are never part of the review team.</p>

<section id="enforcement-guidelines">
<h2>Enforcement Guidelines<a class="headerlink" href="#enforcement-guidelines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The VPLanet Council will determine the consequences of any action they deem in
violation of this Code of Conduct by the following guidelines:</p>
<section id="correction">
<h3>Correction<a class="headerlink" href="#correction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Community Impact</strong>: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.</p>
<p><strong>Consequence</strong>: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.</p>
</section>
<section id="warning">
<h3>Warning<a class="headerlink" href="#warning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Community Impact</strong>: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.</p>
<p><strong>Consequence</strong>: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction
with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing
the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding
interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media.
Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.</p>
</section>
<section id="temporary-ban">
<h3>Temporary Ban<a class="headerlink" href="#temporary-ban" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Community Impact</strong>: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Consequence</strong>: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.</p>
</section>
<section id="permanent-ban">
<h3>Permanent Ban<a class="headerlink" href="#permanent-ban" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Community Impact</strong>: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards,
including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or
aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.</p>
<p><strong>Consequence</strong>: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.</p>
<p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If
an individual engages in unacceptable behavior, the VPLanet Council may take any
action they deem appropriate, including a permanent ban from the community.</p>
