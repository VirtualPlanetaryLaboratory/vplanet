===================   ============

A damped orbital-rotational system can enter a "Cassini state," in which
a planet's rotational axis, orbital axis, and the local total angular momentum
vector are all coplanar. In this case, we consider Teegarden's Star's planetary
system, which consists of two planets that are both affected by tides from the
host star. Here we assume a mutual inclination of ~10 degrees, and all orbital
and physical parameters are consistent with the observations. We assume that
planet b has no water, but planet c does; this choice means that planet b's
damping is 10x weaker than c's. Both planet's damp into a Cassini state.

Evolution of Teegarden's Star b and c into Cassini states, assuming the 2nd order
secular orbital model and the constant-time-lag tidal model. Planet b equilibrates
to an obliquity of about 1 degree, while planet c, which is potentially
habitable, damps to about 9 degrees. Note that planet b's eccentricity
occassionally reaches values larger than 0.23, where the CPL tidal model
predicts its rotation rate will switch to the 3:2 spin-orbit resonance. The
dynamical ellipticity, i.e. oblateness, is calculated by assuming hydrostatic
equilibrium, including the centripetal force.  For both planets, the second
Cassini parameter (bottom right) settles to a value of approximately -1,
indicating the presence of a Cassini state.

Same as previous figure, but with the 4th order secular model.
