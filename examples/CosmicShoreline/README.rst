The blue line is the cosmic shoreline, which is drawn by eye based on Fig. 2
of Zahnle & Catling (2018). The black points are the positions
of Solar System planets. The Sun's XUV luminosity
is assumed to follow the Ribas et al. (2005) model. This figure, while
not as complete as Zahnle & Catling (2018), is a near exact reproduction
for the planets.
