# Example primary input file for VPLANET
sSystemName	earth			# System Name
iVerbose	5			# Verbosity level
bOverwrite	1			# Allow file overwrites?

# All space after a # is ignored, as is white space
# The first lowercase letter(s) denote the cast: b=boolean, i=int, d=double,
# s=string. An "a" indicates an array and multiple arguments are allowed/expected.

# List of "body files" that contain body-specific parameters
saBodyFiles	sun.in $	# The host star
		earth.in	# Earth


# Array options can continue to the next line with a terminating "$". The $ can be
# at the end of the string or not. Comments are allowed afterwards.

# Input/Output Units
sUnitMass	solar		# Options: gram, kg, Earth, Neptune, Jupiter, solar
sUnitLength	aU		# Options: cm, m, km, Earth, Jupiter, solar, AU
sUnitTime	YEARS		# Options: sec, day, year, Myr, Gyr
sUnitAngle	d		# Options: deg, rad
sUnitTemp       K

# Units specified in the primary input file are propagated into the bodies. Otherwise
# specifiy units on a per body basis in the body files.
# Most string arguments can be in any case and need only be unambiguous.

# Input/Output
bDoLog		1		# Write a log file?
iDigits		6		# Maximum number of digits to right of decimal
dMinValue	1e-10		# Minimum value of eccentricity/obliquity

# Option names must be exact in spelling and case.

# Evolution Parameters
bDoForward	1		# Perform a forward evolution?
bVarDt		1		# Use variable timestepping?
dEta		0.1		# Coefficient for variable timestepping
dStopTime	4.5e9  #1e10		# Stop time for evolution
dOutputTime	1e7  # 4.5e9		# Output timesteps (assuming in body files)

# Some options are only permitted in the primary file, some are forbidden.
# That should really be documented!
