===================   ============

This example uses **DistOrb** to model the orbits of the solar system planets and
**DistRot** to model the obliquity evolution of Earth and Mars. In this main
directory, the precession of the Earth's spin axis is forced to its present
day value to emulate the effect of the Moon. In the `womoon <womoon>`_ directory,
the same simulation is run, but without this precessional forcing. The
directory `marsvpl <marsvpl>`_ contains a simulation of Mars' obliquity backward in time
using **DistOrb** and **DistRot**. This result can be compared to `marshnb <marshnb>`_ output, which utilizes
orbital data from :code:`HNBody` (`Rauch & Hamilton 2002 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002DDA....33.0802R/abstract>`_) to demonstrate the effects
of secular resonances not resolved by **DistOrb**. Note that **DistRot** can use orbital
elements generated by non-**VPLanet** sources.
