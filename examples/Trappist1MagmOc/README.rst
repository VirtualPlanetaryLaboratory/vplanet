===================   ============

During the early stages of their life, terrestrial exoplanets are likely to have had completely molten mantles, so-called magma oceans. 
These magma oceans can play an important role in the evolution of volatiles in the planets' atmospheres. 
I.e. they influence the amount of water and oxygen left after the solidification of the magma ocean. 
Thus, magma oceans determine the habitability of rocky planets.
