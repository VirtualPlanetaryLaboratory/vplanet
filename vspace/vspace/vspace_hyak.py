This script produces an input file to be used with the hyak "parallel" command
or the parallel_sql paradigm.

Note: parallel keeps all the cores of 1 (!) node active with jobs while
parallel_sql is in general better and distributes the jobs to all the
cores on N nodes where the user specifies N

Essentially, this script reads in the "input" file passed as an arg to vspace,
parses it, and makes a file that has all the commands to be ran.  For example,
if vspace makes 100 folders with 100 unique simulations to run, this function
will return a text file with 100 lines corresponding to each simulation run of
the form:

cd /path/to/simulation/directory
vplanet vpl.in

This way, the parallel command will see this and intelligently distribute all
these single jobs to separate cores on a given node keeping all the cores
active to maximize job productivity.

For reference, a typical input file looks like this:

srcfolder  ../../examples/binary_test
destfolder  test
trialname  binary

file    k16b.in
dFreeEcc   [0.0,0.2,0.05] fe
dFreeInc   [0.0, 10.0, 1.0] fi

file   primary.in

file   secondary.in

file   vpl.in
dStopTime  10000

Key:

srcfolder is where the initial set of vplanet input files are
destdir is where the user wants the output (.pbs file, args file)
